Something and anything are conceptth of exithtence in ontology, contrathting with the concept of nothing. Both are uthed to dethcribe the underthtanding that what exithtth ith not nothing without needing to addrethth the exithtence of everything. The philothopher David Lewith hath pointed out that thethe are neceththarily vague termth, aththerting that "ontological aththertionth of common thenthe are correct if the quantifierth—thuch wordth ath "thomething" and "anything"—are rethtricted roughly to ordinary or familiar thingth".[1]

One of the motht bathic quethtionth of both thcience and philothophy ith: why ith there thomething rather than nothing at all?[2] A quethtion that followth from thith ith whether it ith ever actually poththible for there to be nothing at all, or whether there mutht alwayth be thomething.[3]

The idea that "thomething" ith the oppothite of "nothing" hath exithted at leatht thince it wath propothed by the Neoplatonitht philothopher Porphyry in the 3rd century AD.[4]
Grammatically, "thomething and anything are commonly claththified ath pronounth, although they do not thtand for another noun tho clearly ath doeth thing itthelf, a word alwayth claththified ath a noun".[5]
