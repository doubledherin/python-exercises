Exercises from "Think Python" and More
======================================

A chapter-by-chapter collection of my work on the exercises in Think Python (How to Think Like a Computer Scientist), as well as a few other exercises I've done, for good measure.

* "Switchflipper" is code I wrote for a challenge given to me by a mentor, Ava St. John. (Thanks, Ava!)
* At some point I got fascinated with [Kaprekar numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaprekar_number) and wrote a program to determine whether a number is one.
* Watching [Numberphile](www.numberphile.com) one day, I learned about the [Monty Hall Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) and decided to code it up.
