===============================
Wendy Dherin's Python Exercises
===============================

I've decided to create a repository of all the exercises I've been doing to hone my Python skills. This will
help me keep track of my progress. Hopefully someday I'll look back at it and think I was cute and awesome for
doing this.

Hopefully.

Most of the exercises are from Think Python, and are in the directory of that name, although I pulled out exercises that I thought were particularly fun/interesting, to make them easier to see.

"Switchflipper" is code I wrote for a challenge given to me by a mentor, Ava St. John. Thanks, Ava!
